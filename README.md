The trained models for round 1 can be downloaded from: https://figshare.com/s/4058d860f7fbf9b89cd2

The Challenge consisted of a “coarse-grained” sub-Challenge, during which participants predicted levels of eight major immune and stromal cell populations [including B cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, NK cells, neutrophils, cells within the monocytic lineage (monocytes/macrophages/dendritic cells), endothelial cells, and fibroblasts].
#### Fine-grained
The trained models for round 1 can be downloaded from: https://figshare.com/s/abe52254e69b8cc27ccc

The Challenge also consisted of a “fine-grained” sub-Challenge, during which participants further dissected major populations into 14 minor sub-populations according to their functional orientation (e.g., naive B cells, memory B cells, naive CD4 T cells, memory CD4 T cells, naive.CD8 T cells, memory CD8 T cells, regulatory T cells, monocytes, macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, NK cells, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts).
